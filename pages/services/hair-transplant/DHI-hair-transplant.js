            The DHI hair transplant technique has certain advantages like being
            a single step procedure and requiring less donor hairs and using
            merely alive hair follicles. In this technique there is virtually no
            scarring as there is no scalpels and stitches during the procedure.
            In addition, going back to normal life after the procedure is quite
            short as there is less time needed for recovery. The recovery time
            in DHI hair transplan is significantly reduced as compared to the
            traditional FUT procedure. Efficiency of this procedure is endorsed
            by superb results in tackling small areas of weakening and thinning
            hair.

            <b>DHI procedure</b>
            <br />
            Under FUE technique as practiced in 3 steps: initially follicle
            grafts are harvested, canals are opened in the recipient area and
            finally harvested grafts are implanted into the canals opened.
          </p>
          <p>
            In DHI hair transplant, the first stage is also harvesting the
            grafts from the donor area donor area, similar to the FUE technique.
            Right after the harvesting with a shorter preservation time with
            implant pen device, grafts are directly transferred to the recipient
            area without opening canals beforehand. Canal is opened within
            seconds with DHI implant pen and the graft is placed into the canal.
            Unlike the FUE method, in a single procedure the canals are opened
            and the follicles are transferred at once. The hair follicles are
            implanted one by one directly to the thinning and wekened area that
            needs to be covered.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Pain-free anesthesia</b>
            <br />
            Prior to harvesting follicle grafts, the donor area is locally
            anesthetized with a pain-free method by using a special device. In
            this process, patients feel no or quite minimal pain or ache. After
            applying anesthesia, hair follicle grafts are harvested from the
            donor area with a special implant pen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike FUE method, canals are not opened in advance of transplant in
            the recipient area in DHI technique. The grafts harvested from the
            donor area are preserved in the implant pen with minimal time
            outside the head and then directly implanted. Canals are opened with
            the tip of the pen stucking into the recipient area and then the
            harvested graft is pushed inside the canal opened. Recovery time is
            faster in DHI technique as scar and damage in the donor and
            recipient areas is minimal.
