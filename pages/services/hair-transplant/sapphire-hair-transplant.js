            <b>Sapphire blade</b>
            <br />
            Blades with sapphire tips are now used in FUE hair transplants for
            not harming tissues and maintaining proper blood circulation in
            opening canals.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Sapphire FUE method, as hair follicles are harvested one by one
            from the donor area and canals are opened in the recipient area with
            the sapphire tips, the incisions are more precise with the
            appropriate angles to give an outstanding natural look. It is quite
            dissapointing for patients when canals are not opened in true angles
            and therefore, the results give a fabricated appearance instead of a
            natural look. Hair follicles are implanted into canals of their
            size. Sapphire tips make it easier to hold the hair follicles in
            canals; angles would not rotate or roots would not displace.
          </p>
          <p>
            Local anesthesia is applied prior to starting the hair for minimal
            or no pain during the procedure.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Sapphire FUE method, smaller and smooth channels are opened
            resulting in minimal tissue damage in the recipient area. In this
            method, hair transplant can be made more frequently. As the
            harvested follicles are implanted more frequently, a more natural
            appearance is obtained. In addition, Sapphire FUE method can also be
            applied in patients with advanced hair loss.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sapphire blades do not lose sharpness over time wheras metal tip
            blades lose their sharpness over the time and cause more tissue
            damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Planning</b>
            <br />
            As in other methods, the donor and recipient areas are thoroughly
            assessed by a doctor or surgeon to identify the severity of hair
            loss, donor quality and follicle grafts require.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Harvesting hair follicles</b>
            <br />
            Harvesting is made one by one to generate optimal number of
            follicles with easyly healing tiny incisions. Extraction is not
            arbitrarily made, instead with equal distance to each other to
            ensure symmetry for natural look when hair grow.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Opening canals in recipient area</b> <br />
            In hair transplant, opening canal is utmost critical for the density
            of hair and a natural outlook. In opening canals sapphire blade tips
            are the guarantee for unharmed tissue and blood circulation for
            outstanding results. Blades with sapphire tips are superior to steel
            blades.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Implanting grafts</b>
            <br />
            Harvested grafts are implaned into the planned recipient area one by
            one. In placing the grafts, angle and density are precisely
            determined while grafts harvested from the donor area. This is
            strategically important as placements are directly related with a
            natural look for successful results.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Advantages of Sapphire technique</b>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>More natural result</li>
            <li>Permanent solution for hair loss</li>
            <li>
              Solid crystal instead of metal slit with no decline in sharpness
            </li>
            <li>
              Minimised swelling, tissue damage and trauma in canals opened
            </li>
            <li>Enhanced graft survival</li>
            <li>Smaller canals enabling faster recovery</li>
            <li>Antimicrobial</li>
            <li>No suture, stitch or wound scar</li>
            <li>Short treatment period</li>
            <li>Fast healing</li>
            <li>Donor area recovers within a week with no scars.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Serial sessions of treatment would easily be applied every other
            day. Up to 4000 - 4500 FUs can be harvested on each session and up
            to 10000 hair can be transplanted in one session. Due to the density
            of hairs required for natural results in some cases, the FUE hair
            transplant may well take a substantial time, of course, upon the
            consultation with the patient. Unlike conventional method, there is
            no need to wait between sessions. No numbness, bleeding or scar
            develops in the donor area and removal of suture is not required.
            Recovery period is faster since a scalp strip is not removed from
            the posterior neck. In case follicles are not adequate, FUs can be
            harvested from the different parts of the body (chest, back,
            abdomen, leg etc.) and transferred to the recipient area. Although,
            hair transplant time differs with each patient, the procedure is
            completed within 6 - 8 hours on average.
          </p>
          <p>
            To avoid lack of intervention in inevitable complications the hair
            transplant procedures are made in designated hospitals.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Painless transplant</b>
            <br />
            You should not delay your transplant due to fear of pain. FUE is a
            new technique and thanks to developing technologies making viable
            pain free procedures; with either no or quite minimal pain. Local
            anesthesia sedation makes almost no pain sense during the procedure.
            Accordingly, the FUE brings a more pleasant hair transplant process.
            The FUE technique is also perfect for patients with needle fear.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Prior to procedure</b>
            <br />
            Before the hair transplant procedure patients contact designated
            consultants for identifying the bespoke treatment and responding all
            patient questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the patients book their travel arrangements, special hosts will
            meet upon their arrival to Istanbul airports and taken to hotels or
            hospitals. Certain essential tests are made when patients arrive
            hospitals and clinics for evaluating suitability of patients for
            respective procedures. In planning the procedure, patient gender,
            age and current state of hair and head shape are assessed and
            consdered. Subsequent to such tests the procedure plan is set and
            the procedure designed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Things to consider prior to the hair transplant procedure</b>
            <br />
            It is utmost essential a patient shares his / her complete health
            history and current state of health with doctors; including but not
            limited to regular use of medicine, treatment, allergy and other
            health conditions which would have an adverse affect on patient
            during or after the procedure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Smoking intake of alcohol, and use of blood thinner should be
            interrupted before the operation to avoid risk of complications
            during or after the operation and delays of recovery. Therefore,
            smoking and intake of alcohol should be interrupted some time before
            hair transplant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Patients are suggested to wear comfortable attire on the procedure
            day.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>After the procedure</b>Before the hair transplant procedure
            patients contact designated consultants for identifying the bespoke
            treatment and responding all patient questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the patients book their travel arrangements, special hosts will
            meet upon their arrival to Istanbul airports and taken to hotels or
            hospitals. Certain essential tests are made when patients arrive
            hospitals and clinics for evaluating suitability of patients for
            respective procedures. In planning the procedure, patient gender,
            age and current state of hair and head shape are assessed and
            consdered. Subsequent to such tests the procedure plan is set and
            the procedure designed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>After care</b>
            <br />
            The first special wash is made right after the hair transplant in
            the clinic. Every patient will be guided with for a self after care.
            The hair follicles transplanted immediately after the hair
            transplant are sensitive and vulnerable. Therefore, they can easily
            be fractured and damaged since the follicles newly transplanted are
            not strong and firmly hold on to the recipient area. Accordingly,
            prior to the patient applying the after care washing, a clinic
            specialist perform the first wash and teaches the patient how to do
            attentively. • Using doctor recommended self after care shampoo and
            other products.
