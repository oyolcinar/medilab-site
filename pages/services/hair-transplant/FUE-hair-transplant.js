          The FUE technique is based on extraction of the hair FUs (graft) using
          a special micromotor without any surgical blade, by using special
          microforceps without harming the deep loose tissues. After FUs are
          extracted from the donor area, each graft is cut in excess tissue and
          brought to the ideal size for the recipient area. Local anesthesia is
          induced at both donor and recipient areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Advantages of FUE technique</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>More natural result</li>
          <li>More intensive hair transplant</li>
          <li>Permanent solution for hair loss</li>
          <li>No suture, stitch or wound scar</li>
          <li>Short treatment period</li>
          <li>Fast healing</li>
          <li>No damage to donor area</li>
          <li>Rapid return to daily life activities in postoperative period</li>
          <li>Less or no pain in intra-or post-operative period</li>
          <li>Generally single session procedure</li>
          <li>Donor area recovers within a week with no scars.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Serial sessions of treatment would easily be applied every other day.
          Up to 4000 - 4500 FUs can be harvested on each session and up to 10000
          hair can be transplanted in one session. Due to the density of hairs
          required for natural results in some cases, the FUE hair transplant
          may well take a substantial time, of course, upon the consultation
          with the patient. Unlike conventional method, there is no need to wait
          between sessions. No numbness, bleeding or scar develops in the donor
          area and removal of suture is not required. Recovery period is faster
          since a scalp strip is not removed from the posterior neck. In case
          follicles are not adequate, FUs can be harvested from the different
          parts of the body (chest, back, abdomen, leg etc.) and transferred to
          the recipient area. Although, hair transplant time differs with each
          patient, the procedure is completed within 6 - 8 hours on average.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid lack of intervention in inevitable complications the hair
          transplant procedures are made in designated hospitals.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Painless transplant</b>
          <br />
          You should not delay your transplant due to fear of pain. FUE is a new
          technique and thanks to developing technologies making viable pain
          free procedures; with either no or quite minimal pain. Local
          anesthesia sedation makes almost no pain sense during the procedure.
          Accordingly, the FUE brings a more pleasant hair transplant process.
          The FUE technique is also perfect for patients with needle fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Prior to procedure</b>
          <br />
          Before the hair transplant procedure patients contact designated
          consultants for identifying the bespoke treatment and responding all
          patient questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the patients book their travel arrangements, special hosts will
          meet upon their arrival to Istanbul airports and taken to hotels or
          hospitals. Certain essential tests are made when patients arrive
          hospitals and clinics for evaluating suitability of patients for
          respective procedures. In planning the procedure, patient gender, age
          and current state of hair and head shape are assessed and consdered.
          Subsequent to such tests the procedure plan is set and the procedure
          designed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Things to consider prior to the hair transplant procedure</b>
          <br />
          It is utmost essential a patient shares his / her complete health
          history and current state of health with doctors; including but not
          limited to regular use of medicine, treatment, allergy and other
          health conditions which would have an adverse affect on patient during
          or after the procedure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Smoking intake of alcohol, and use of blood thinner should be
          interrupted before the operation to avoid risk of complications during
          or after the operation and delays of recovery. Therefore, smoking and
          intake of alcohol should be interrupted some time before hair
          transplant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Patients are suggested to wear comfortable attire on the procedure
          day.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>After the procedure</b>Before the hair transplant procedure

          <b>After care</b>
          <br />
          The first special wash is made right after the hair transplant in the
          clinic. Every patient will be guided with for a self after care. The
          hair follicles transplanted immediately after the hair transplant are
          sensitive and vulnerable. Therefore, they can easily be fractured and
          damaged since the follicles newly transplanted are not strong and
          firmly hold on to the recipient area. Accordingly, prior to the
          patient applying the after care washing, a clinic specialist perform
          the first wash and teaches the patient how to do attentively. â€¢ Using
