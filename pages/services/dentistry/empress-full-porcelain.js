          Empress crowns are a kind of porcelain that provides translucency,
          ability to reflect and transmit the light and therefore a natural
          look. The material’s resistance is increased by firing glass ceramic
          over a crystalline core that is compress under pressure.

            The procedure starts with taking the photos and measures of the
            patient’s face and mouth. In order to give an idea of the results to
            the patient, our dentists use a program called “Mock up” to show the
            possible outcomes. Once the ideal look is chosen, our dentists apply
            local anesthesia to the patient to extract a 2mm part from the tooth
            and send it to the laboratory. During the waiting process, the
            patient is given temporary teeth according to their natural tooth
            color.
          </p>

            Empress crowns can be used in the front of the mouth and not in
            zones that chewing and grinding occurs. As the tooth is cut during
            the procedure, patients may experience sensitivity for the first few
            days. When necessary, the sensitivity can be minimized by applying
            root canal treatment.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the crowns are shaped in a compatible form with the patient’s
            tooth, there are no areas under the crown for plaque or bacteria to
            grow. Therefore, there is no risk for the patients to experience
            decays. It can be used safely for a long period after the treatment.

            <b>Empress or Zirconium?</b>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Empress and Zirconium both prove great results and frequently used
              by dentists.
            </li>
            <li>
              They both don’t include metal base and therefore they are
              aesthetically pleasing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Empress crowns are preferred when dental bridges are not required.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the patient requires a frontal teeth treatment for one or two
              teeth, empress crowns are preferred. If further aesthetics and
              urability is needed, then zirconium is recommended.
