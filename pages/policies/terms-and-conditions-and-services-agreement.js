        <b>1. Medical Procedure</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Limitation of Liability:</b> Medilab Estetik is not a treating
        physician, any other medical provider or does not provide medical advice
        nor does perform any surgery or medical procedure or control any Medical
        Procedure Provider facility or service rendered by them but rather acts
        only in the capacity of facilitator and coordinator. Information
        provided by Medilab Estetik is based on the best publicly available
        information and is not intended in any way to be used as a substitute
        for advice from a patient’s physician. Your treatment forms and prompts
        a contractual relationship between you and the Medical Procedure
        Provider providing the medical procedure and treatment. We do not hold
        medical qualifications and shall not be held responsible or liable for
        any medical procedures provided through your chosen Medical Procedure
        Provider. Nor shall be held responsible or liable for any care,
        treatment or other services you are provided with by the same, or for
        any malpractice claims that may arise directly or indirectly from their
        advice. Similarly, we shall not take any responsibility or liability for
        the complications and dissatisfactions arising from Medical Procedure
        Provider’s treatments. You acknowledge that you have conducted the
        necessary due diligence with respect to the risks involved in the
        medical procedure you choose and have decided to seek treatment with no
        influence or pressure from Medilab Estetik. Our role is solely to
        facilitate and coordinate a consultation between you and your Medical
        Procedure Provider. We strongly recommend that you carefully read and
        put reliance to Medical Procedure Provider’s terms and conditions and
        medical procedure “Patient Consent Form”, which is not described herein
        as proprietary, prior to proceeding with your treatment. In addition, be
        aware that Medilab Estetik offers no insurance, guarantee or warranty in
        any respect related to services delivered or rendered by Medical
        Procedure Provider.
      </p>
      <p>
        The treatment plans offered by Medilab Estetik as a result of email
        exchanges, telephone conversations or video consultations are purely
        based on the information (i.e. the pictures, videos, medical images,
        test results, prescriptions, etc) provided by you and reviewed by the
        Medical Procedure Provider. Therefore, your treatment plan may change
        when the Medical Procedure Provider and respective doctor to undertake
        the procedure examines you in person before your medical procedure. You
        have an option to reconsider your position and do not undertake the
        procedure if such a change arise. In such circumstances, you will
        receive a refund after pro rata deductions for operational services for
        your specific procedure, consultations, tests and examines by your
        designated doctor. Please be advised that we are not in a position to
        reimburse operational costs such as travel, transfer and accommodation
        due to using third party providers to make such arrangements as we do
        not directly operate and control these providers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon your examination and consultation leading into a new Medical
        Procedure, we will quote you the revised price if you agree to go with
        it. Accordingly, the advance payment, additional costs and the remainder
        balance of the total price will be adjusted, based on the initial
        payments to be made or already made. Based on the change and duration of
        stay, the additional operational costs for further travel and
        accommodation etc. will be factored in the price adjustment. Medilab
        Estetik takes no responsibility for new circumstances and cannot be held
        liable for the disorder and disarrangement of such additional
        operational costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        By acknowledging and accepting these T&C, you agree not to hold Medilab
        Estetik responsible for medical complications, medical negligence or
        malpractice by your chosen Medical Procedure Provider.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Non-Disparagement:</b> By accepting these Terms and Conditions, you
        agree not to offence or negatively criticise publicly Medilab Estetik,
        its directors or any of its employee, associate or business partner in
        physical or virtual meetings or platforms such as websites, social media
        networks, blogs, public forums etc., in regards to Medical Procedure
        Provider’s procedures and actions. As Medilab Estetik cannot be held
        responsible for the services, medical procedures and treatments provided
        by the Medical Procedure Provider, you agree not to associate bad
        reputation to Medilab Estetik, its directors or any of its employees or
        initiate any action that negatively affects Medilab Estetik, its
        reputation or services at any time during or subsequent to contract
        period.
      </p>
      <p>
        In case we evaluate with factual corroboration that this clause has been
        breached by you, you agree to withdraw and unload the negative content
        without any delay. If content not withdrawn or unloaded, in part or in
        whole, you agree to pay £4,000 to Medilab Estetik to compensate any
        harm.
      </p>
      <p>

        complications, if arise any, from the travel lies with you and so is an
        insurance covering any risks of such complications to indemnify you for
        any losses from travel and medical problems. We offer no insurance,
        guarantee or warranty in any respect related to products or services

        an approved insurer. Your acceptance of these T&C constitutes acceptance
        of this obligation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Costs & Payment</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on your choice of services, your Medical Procedure Package
        price will include the costs of selection of one, more or all of the
        following:
      </p>
      <p>
        a) Healthcare service / medical procedure / surgery,
        <br />
        b) Accommodation,
        <br />
        c) Private transfers,
        <br />
        d) Host,
        <br />
        e) Any basic pre-operative tests you are advised to take upon your
        initial consultation.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will be separately charged for any additional tests considered
        necessary other than basic pre-operative tests because of a pre-existing
        condition or your exposure or vulnerability to any condition, and any
        unanticipated cost that are unrelated to the desired procedure,
        complications that are unrelated and/or not detected prior to the
        procedure. Your Medical Procedure Package may include stay at the
        hospital whenever required and specifically addressed in your package.
        In cases where you stay more than specified, additional nights will be
        charged to you at the current rates of the hospital or clinic. These
        charges would be in addition to the total cost of the Medical Procedure
        Package indicated in the initial price quotation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have accepted the price quote provided to you for the treatment
        you choose with a link to these T&C, also meaning that you accept the
        T&C in this Agreement, you will be required to make an advance deposit
        payment to us via credit card, debit card or bank transfer. Your advance
        deposit is non-refundable as it constitutes only a small portion of the
        total package price. The remainder of your balance, being the Medical
        Procedure Package price minus the advance deposit, must be paid prior to
        your departure from your home country. Obtaining the full payment does
        not hold us liable for the services provided by the Medical Procedure
        Provider.
      </p>
      <p>
        Non-payment of the full Medical Procedure Package price, prior to your
        departure from your home country, will be regarded as a breach of this
        Agreement and Medilab Estetik will not be bound to commit to deliver any
        services to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>5. Your Medical Background and Records</b>

        planned surgery. By accepting these T&C, you agree to allow us to share
        the details of your medical history, including your pictures, videos,
        medical images, test results, prescriptions etc, with your Medical
        Procedure Provider. We will not be held liable if your medical history
